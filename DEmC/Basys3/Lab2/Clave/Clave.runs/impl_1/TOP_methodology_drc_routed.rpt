Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell B1/FSM_onehot_actual[9]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) B1/FSM_onehot_actual_reg[0]/PRE, B1/FSM_onehot_actual_reg[1]/CLR,
B1/FSM_onehot_actual_reg[2]/CLR, B1/FSM_onehot_actual_reg[3]/CLR,
B1/FSM_onehot_actual_reg[4]/CLR, B1/FSM_onehot_actual_reg[5]/CLR,
B1/FSM_onehot_actual_reg[6]/CLR, B1/FSM_onehot_actual_reg[7]/CLR,
B1/FSM_onehot_actual_reg[8]/CLR, B1/FSM_onehot_actual_reg[9]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
